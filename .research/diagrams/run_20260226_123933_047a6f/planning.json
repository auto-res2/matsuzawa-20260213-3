The background is a clean, pure white. Each stage will be represented by a rectangular box with rounded corners. Arrows will indicate the flow of data and processing steps between stages.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Input Question:**\n    *   A rectangular box on the far left, with rounded corners.\n    *   Label: \"Input Question\" (bold, sans-serif font).\n    *   Content: A small question mark icon inside the box.\n    *   Fill color: Light pastel yellow.\n\n2.  **Forward Solve Sampling:**\n    *   A rectangular box to the right of \"Input Question,\" with rounded corners.\n    *   Label: \"Forward Solve Sampling (N Candidate Solutions)\" (bold, sans-serif font, multi-line).\n    *   Content: A small icon representing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (e.g., a thought bubble connected to multiple smaller bubbles).\n    *   Fill color: Light pastel green.\n    *   Output: N arrows emanating from the right side of this box, each representing a \"Candidate Solution (Reasoning Chain + Answer)\". Each arrow points to the \"Backsolve Verification\" box.\n\n3.  **Backsolve Verification:**\n    *   A rectangular box to the right of \"Forward Solve Sampling,\" with rounded corners.\n    *   Label: \"Backsolve Verification\" (bold, sans-serif font).\n    *   Content: An icon of a magnifying glass examining a document.\n    *   Fill color: Light pastel blue.\n    *   Outputs:\n        *   An arrow labeled \"b_score (0-1)\" pointing to the \"Weighted Aggregation\" box.\n        *   An arrow labeled \"Verdict (PASS/FAIL)\" pointing to the \"Weighted Aggregation\" box.\n\n4.  **Falsification Ensemble:**\n    *   A rectangular box positioned below \"Backsolve Verification,\" with rounded corners.\n    *   Label: \"Falsification Ensemble (K Adversarial Attempts)\" (bold, sans-serif font, multi-line).\n    *   Content: An icon representing adversarial attacks (e.g., a shield being struck by multiple arrows).\n    *   Fill color: Light pastel orange.\n    *   Output: An arrow labeled \"f_score (1 - mean(error_prob))\" pointing to the \"Weighted Aggregation\" box.\n\n5.  **Anti-Verbosity Regularization:**\n    *   A rectangular box positioned below \"Backsolve Verification\" and to the right of \"Falsification Ensemble\", with rounded corners.\n    *   Label: \"Anti-Verbosity Regularization\" (bold, sans-serif font).\n    *   Content: An icon representing penalization (e.g., a token counter with a down arrow).\n    *   Fill color: Light pastel purple.\n    *   Output: An arrow labeled \"l_score = exp(-\u03bb * token_count / tokens0)\" pointing to the \"Weighted Aggregation\" box.\n\n6.  **Weighted Aggregation:**\n    *   A large rectangular box on the far right, encompassing the outputs of \"Backsolve Verification\", \"Falsification Ensemble\" and \"Anti-Verbosity Regularization\", with rounded corners.\n    *   Label: \"Weighted Aggregation\" (bold, sans-serif font).\n    *   Content: An icon representing a summation symbol (\u03a3) and a weighting scale.\n    *   Fill color: Soft sky blue.\n    *   Input: Arrows from \"Backsolve Verification\" (b_score, Verdict), \"Falsification Ensemble\" (f_score), and \"Anti-Verbosity Regularization\" (l_score).\n    *   Internal steps (represented as smaller, internal boxes or labels within the larger \"Weighted Aggregation\" box):\n        *   \"weight = (b_score^\u03b1) * (f_score^\u03b2) * l_score\" (small label).\n        *   \"Group candidates by answer value\" (small label).\n        *   \"Sum weights per answer\" (small label).\n        *   \"Select answer with maximum total weight\" (small label).\n    *   Output: A thick arrow pointing rightward, labeled \"Final Answer (Selected)\".\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   Arrows are solid lines with a medium thickness (2 points).\n*   Arrowheads are filled and triangular.\n*   Arrows representing scores (b\\_score, f\\_score, l\\_score) are slightly curved to visually distinguish them.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   A very light grey dashed rectangle can optionally surround the \"Backsolve Verification\", \"Falsification Ensemble\", and \"Anti-Verbosity Regularization\" boxes with a label above the rectangle: \"Verification & Refinement\".\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   All labels use a clear, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica).\n*   Mathematical notations (b\\_score, f\\_score, l\\_score, \u03bb, \u03b1, \u03b2) are rendered correctly.\n*   Labels are positioned clearly above or below the arrows to indicate the data being transferred.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   The \"Input Question\" is the primary input to the entire pipeline.\n*   The \"Final Answer (Selected)\" is the final output.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   Color Palette: Soft pastels (yellow, green, blue, orange, purple, sky blue).\n*   Line Weight: Medium (2 points) for arrows, thinner (1 point) for box outlines.\n*   Icon Style: Simple, flat icons.\n*   Font: Sans-serif (Arial or Helvetica).\n*   Overall: Clean, professional, and easy to understand.\n",

  "description": "**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe diagram presents a top-to-bottom flow, clearly illustrating the four stages of the FAB-SC method: Forward Sampling, Backsolve Check, Falsification Ensemble, and Weighted Aggregation. Each stage is represented by a distinct rectangular box. The overall background is a very light cream color.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Stage 1: Forward Sampling:**\n    *   A large rounded rectangle at the top, labeled \"Stage 1: Forward Sampling\" in bold, dark blue sans-serif text. The box has a thin, solid dark grey border. The box is filled with a very light beige color.\n    *   Inside the box:\n        *   Text: \"Generate *m* reasoning chains (CoT, Temp=0.7)\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   Text: \"Extract candidate answers\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   A small icon representing multiple branching paths (like a decision tree) to visually signify the diverse reasoning chains. The icon is colored in shades of warm orange and soft yellow.\n        *   Output: An arrow pointing downwards, labeled \"*m* Candidate Answers\" in italicized serif font.\n\n2.  **Stage 2a: Backsolve Check (B-score):**\n    *   A rounded rectangle below \"Forward Sampling\", labeled \"Stage 2a: Backsolve Check (B-score)\" in bold, dark blue sans-serif text. It also has a thin, solid dark grey border. The box is filled with a very light beige color.\n    *   Inside the box:\n        *   Text: \"Plug answer into original problem\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   Text: \"Verify problem constraints\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   A small icon representing a checkmark inside a circle, colored in a medium-saturation green.\n        *   Output: Two arrows pointing to the right, one labeled \"Confidence Score (0-1)\" and the other \"Verdict (PASS/FAIL)\" in italicized serif font.\n\n3.  **Stage 2b: Falsification Ensemble (F-score):**\n    *   A rounded rectangle next to \"Backsolve Check\", horizontally aligned with it, labeled \"Stage 2b: Falsification Ensemble (F-score)\" in bold, dark blue sans-serif text, also with a thin, solid dark grey border. The box is filled with a very light beige color.\n    *   Inside the box:\n        *   Text: \"Run *k* adversarial 'refuter' prompts\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   Three smaller rounded rectangles, stacked vertically, each representing a type of error. These smaller boxes are filled with different shades of soft peach (light peach, salmon, rose). Each has a small magnifying glass icon.\n            *   \"Unit Conversion/Quantity Misreads\"\n            *   \"Algebraic/Arithmetic Errors\"\n            *   \"Constraint Violations\"\n        *   Text: \"F-score = 1 - mean(error_probability)\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   Output: An arrow pointing downwards, labeled \"F-score (0-1)\" in italicized serif font.\n\n4.  **Stage 3: Anti-Verbosity Regularization (L-score):**\n    *   A rounded rectangle below \"Backsolve Check\" and \"Falsification Ensemble\", centered horizontally, labeled \"Stage 3: Anti-Verbosity Regularization (L-score)\" in bold, dark blue sans-serif text, with a thin, solid dark grey border. The box is filled with a very light beige color.\n    *   Inside the box:\n        *   Text: \"L-score = exp(-\u03bb \u00d7 token_count / tokens\u2080)\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   Text: \"Penalize verbose reasoning chains\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   A small icon representing a chat bubble with a crossed-out \"ABC\" to signify verbosity reduction, colored in light grey.\n        *   Output: An arrow pointing downwards, labeled \"L-score (0-1)\" in italicized serif font.\n\n5.  **Stage 4: Weighted Aggregation:**\n    *   A large rounded rectangle at the bottom, labeled \"Stage 4: Weighted Aggregation\" in bold, dark blue sans-serif text, with a thin, solid dark grey border. The box is filled with a very light beige color.\n    *   Inside the box:\n        *   Text: \"Combined weight: w = B<sup>\u03b1</sup> \u00d7 F<sup>\u03b2</sup> \u00d7 L\" in regular black sans-serif font. The exponents \u03b1 and \u03b2 should be rendered as superscripts.\n        *   Text: \"Group answers by value, sum weights\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   Text: \"Select answer with maximum total weight\" in regular black sans-serif font.\n        *   A small icon representing a set of stacked bars (histogram) with one bar highlighted to show the maximum value, colored in shades of lavender.\n        *   Input: Arrows from \"Backsolve Check (B-score)\", \"Falsification Ensemble (F-score)\", and \"Anti-Verbosity Regularization (L-score)\" boxes, each labeled with corresponding score (\"B-score\", \"F-score\", \"L-score\") in italicized serif font.\n        *   Output: An arrow pointing downwards, labeled \"Final Answer\" in italicized serif font.\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   Solid dark grey arrows connect the boxes, indicating the flow of data and processing.\n*   The arrow from \"Forward Sampling\" splits into two, one going to \"Backsolve Check\" and the other to \"Falsification Ensemble\".\n*   Arrows from \"Backsolve Check\", \"Falsification Ensemble\", and \"Anti-Verbosity Regularization\" converge into the \"Weighted Aggregation\" box.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   The entire diagram is enclosed within a very light cream background.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   All boxes are clearly labeled with the stage name and any relevant score abbreviations.\n*   Mathematical formulas are displayed using standard mathematical notation.\n*   Arrows are labeled to indicate the data being passed between stages.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   Input: Implicitly, the original problem is the input to the \"Forward Sampling\" stage (represented by a small text box above Stage 1 labeled \"Original Problem\" in italicized serif font).\n*   Output: The \"Final Answer\" is the final output of the entire process.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   Background: Very light cream.\n*   Boxes: Very light beige fill with thin, solid dark grey borders.\n*   Text: Dark blue for stage titles, regular black for descriptions.\n*   Arrows: Solid dark grey with arrowheads.\n*   Icons: Simple, flat design, using a consistent pastel color palette (orange/yellow, green, peach, grey, purple).\n*   Line Weights: Thin lines for borders and arrows.",

  "initial_description": "Here's a detailed textual description of the illustrative diagram for the Falsification-Augmented Bidirectional Self-Consistency (FAB-SC) methodology.\n\n**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe diagram presents a top-to-bottom flow, visually representing the five sequential steps of the FAB-SC pipeline. Each step is represented as a distinct, clearly labeled rectangular box. The flow is indicated by downward-pointing arrows connecting the boxes. The overall background is a very light pastel yellow.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Forward Solve Sampling:** A rectangular box at the top, labeled \"1. Forward Solve Sampling\". Inside the box, the text \"Sample m=8 stochastic CoT solutions (T=0.7)\" is displayed. A small icon representing multiple branching paths (like a decision tree) is placed in the top-right corner of this box to visually represent the \"sampling\" aspect. An arrow exits from the bottom of this box. The box has a light sky blue fill. The border is solid dark blue.\n\n2.  **Backsolve (Plug-Back) Verification:** A rectangular box below the first, labeled \"2. Backsolve (Plug-Back) Verification\". Inside the box, the text \"Verification Prompt (x, a_i, r_i) \u2192 CONFIDENCE: B_i \u2208 [0,1], VERDICT (PASS/FAIL) (T=0.3)\". A small icon representing a checkmark inside a circle is placed in the top-right corner of this box. An arrow exits from the bottom of this box. The box has a light green fill. The border is solid dark green.\n\n3.  **Adversarial Falsification Ensemble:** A rectangular box below the second, labeled \"3. Adversarial Falsification Ensemble\". Inside the box, the text \"k=3 Refuter Prompts (Unit/Quantity, Algebra/Arithmetic, Constraint Completeness) \u2192 ERROR_PROB: p_{i,j} \u2208 [0,1] (T=0.7)\". A small icon representing a magnifying glass examining a document is placed in the top-right corner of this box. Below the text, the equation \"F_i = 1 - (1/k) * \u03a3 p_{i,j}\" is displayed. An arrow exits from the bottom of this box. The box has a light orange fill. The border is solid dark orange.\n\n4.  **Anti-Verbosity Length Penalty:** A rectangular box below the third, labeled \"4. Anti-Verbosity Length Penalty\". Inside the box, the text \"Rationale Length: t_i \u2192 L_i = exp(-\u03bb_{length} * t_i / t_0), \u03bb_{length}=0.001, t_0=200\". A small icon representing a ruler measuring text length is placed in the top-right corner of this box. An arrow exits from the bottom of this box. The box has a light pink fill. The border is solid dark pink.\n\n5.  **Importance-Weighted Aggregation:** A rectangular box at the bottom, labeled \"5. Importance-Weighted Aggregation\". Inside the box, the text \"w_i = (B_i^\u03b1) * (F_i^\u03b2) * L_i, \u03b1=1.0, \u03b2=1.0 \u2192 \u00e2 = argmax_a \u03a3_{i: a_i=a} w_i\". A small icon representing a weighing scale is placed in the top-right corner of this box. An arrow exits from the bottom of this box, pointing to the right, and is labeled \"Final Answer\". The box has a light purple fill. The border is solid dark purple.\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   Solid, dark gray arrows connect each box in a sequential manner from top to bottom, indicating the flow of the pipeline. The arrows have a moderate thickness (around 2pt).\n*   Each arrow is labeled with the data being passed between the steps.\n    *   Arrow 1-2: \"(r_i, a_i)\"\n    *   Arrow 2-3: \"B_i\"\n    *   Arrow 3-4: \"F_i\"\n    *   Arrow 4-5: \"L_i\"\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   No explicit groupings are used beyond the sequential arrangement. The distinct color fills of each box visually separate the steps.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   Each box is clearly labeled with its step number and a descriptive name.\n*   Mathematical notations are used within the boxes to represent the calculations performed in each step (e.g., \"F_i = 1 - (1/k) * \u03a3 p_{i,j}\").\n*   Temperature values (T=0.7, T=0.3) are indicated in parentheses for the sampling and verification steps.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   The input to the entire pipeline is implicitly the \"Question x\" which is mentioned in steps 2.\n*   The output of the pipeline is the \"Final Answer\" (\u00e2), represented by the arrow exiting the last box.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   Background: Very light pastel yellow.\n*   Box Fills: light sky blue, light green, light orange, light pink, light purple\n*   Border Colors: solid dark blue, solid dark green, solid dark orange, solid dark pink, solid dark purple\n*   Arrow Color: Dark gray.\n*   Line Weight: Arrows are 2pt thick, box borders are 1.5pt thick.\n*   Font: Sans-serif font is used throughout the diagram.\n*   Icon Style: Simple, flat, monochrome icons are used in the top-right corner of each box to represent the action performed in that step.\n",
